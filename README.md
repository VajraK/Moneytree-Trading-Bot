# Moneytree Tracking Bot

The Moneytree Trading Bot (MTdB) is a Python-based tool designed to monitor Ethereum blockchain transactions for specific token swaps. It receives transaction details from the Moneytree Tracking Bot (MTB) and evaluates the token's price in real-time. The bot can automatically purchase tokens when specified conditions are met and continuously monitor the token price. If the token price increases or decreases by a specified percentage, the bot sells the token and calculates the profit or loss. The bot also sends notifications to a designated Telegram chat to report buying and selling actions.
